# Encrypted Heroes 3 data

This data is needed to run VCMI's unit tests

Created by copying the folders `Data`, `Maps` and `Mp3` from a Heroes 3 installation into the folder of this repository and running `.\encrypt-all.sh <password>`. The script is based on this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/johnnyopao/33c6500bda474a7afb33207489d8e8e5).

Files can be decrypted like this: `.\decrypt-all.sh <password>`
